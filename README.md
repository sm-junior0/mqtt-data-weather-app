# 🌦️ MQTT Weather Station Application

Welcome to the **MQTT Weather Station Application**! This project is designed to collect, store, and visualize temperature and humidity data in real-time using MQTT, SQLite, and a responsive web interface. Whether you're monitoring your home environment or building a weather station, this app has you covered!

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:
   - The frontend connects to an MQTT broker to receive real-time temperature and humidity data.
   - Each MQTT message is sent to the backend for processing.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Raw data is stored in an SQLite database for historical analysis.
   - Every 5 minutes, the backend calculates averages and stores them in a separate table.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - The frontend displays real-time data and up to one hour of historical data (twelve 5-minute intervals) using interactive charts.

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following REST API endpoints:

- **`POST /api/weather/data`**: Stores raw temperature and humidity readings.
- **`GET /api/weather/history`**: Retrieves historical data for charting.

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### Raw Data Table
Stores every reading received from the MQTT broker:
```sql
CREATE TABLE raw_data (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'temperature' or 'humidity'
  value REAL NOT NULL,       -- The actual reading
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL    
);
```

### Average Data Table
Stores 5-minute averages for temperature and humidity:
```sql
CREATE TABLE avg_data (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  avg_temperature REAL,      -- 5-minute average temperature
  avg_humidity REAL,         -- 5-minute average humidity
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL    
);
```

## 🌟 Why Use This App?

- **Real-Time Insights**: Stay updated with live environmental data.
- **Historical Analysis**: Analyze trends over time with stored data.
- **Easy Setup**: Get started quickly with minimal configuration.
- **Open Source**: Customize and extend the app to fit your needs.
